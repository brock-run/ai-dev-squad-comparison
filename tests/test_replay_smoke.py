"""
Replay Smoke Tests for CI

These are lightweight tests that verify the basic record-replay functionality
works correctly. They use mocked LLM responses for deterministic testing.

Following the adjustment plan: "Record 1 run with a MockLLM (deterministic outputs).
Replay; assert N_event_mismatches == 0."
