## Notes

- Each task builds incrementally on previous tasks
- All tasks maintain backward compatibility with Phase 1
- AI features are designed to gracefully degrade when AI services are unavailable
- Security and privacy are integrated throughout, not added as an afterthought
- Performance optimization is considered from the beginning, not retrofitted
- Learning system improves over time without requiring manual intervention
