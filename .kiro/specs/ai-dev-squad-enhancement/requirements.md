# AI Dev Squad Comparison Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive enhancement of the AI Dev Squad Comparison project to transform it from a basic framework comparison tool into a robust, standardized, and production-ready platform for evaluating AI agent orchestration frameworks. The enhancement addresses critical gaps in safety, standardization, observability, and reproducibility while adding significant new capabilities.

The current project provides basic implementations of several orchestrator frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, n8n, Semantic Kernel, Claude Code Subagents) with limited Ollama integration and basic benchmarking. The enhanced version will establish industry-standard practices for AI agent evaluation, comprehensive safety controls, and enterprise-grade observability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Common Agent API and Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating AI orchestration frameworks, I want a standardized interface across all frameworks so that I can compare them fairly without implementation-specific biases affecting the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any orchestrator is invoked THEN it SHALL implement the AgentAdapter protocol with configure(), run_task(), and events() methods
2. WHEN a task is executed THEN the system SHALL return a standardized RunResult with status, artifacts, timings, tokens, costs, and trace_id
3. WHEN configuration is provided THEN all orchestrators SHALL accept uniform Task schema with id, type, inputs, repo_path, vcs_provider, mode, seed, and model_prefs
4. WHEN events are requested THEN all orchestrators SHALL provide structured Event objects with consistent schema
5. WHEN multiple orchestrators run the same task THEN they SHALL receive identical input parameters and context

### Requirement 2: Central Safety and Execution Controls

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all agent-generated code to be executed in a secure sandbox so that malicious or erroneous code cannot harm my system or access unauthorized resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN safety policies are violated THEN the system SHALL log the violation and provide clear feedback to the user
6. WHEN LLM judge evaluation is enabled THEN potentially harmful outputs SHALL be evaluated before execution
7. WHEN policy configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL support per-task overrides via YAML configuration

### Requirement 3: Enhanced VCS Integration (GitHub and GitLab)

7. WHEN new orchestrators are benchmarked THEN they SHALL support both autonomous and advisory modes with clear documentation of any limitations
8. WHEN integration is complete THEN all new orchestrators SHALL pass the same safety and VCS integration requirements as existing frameworks
9. WHEN directory structure is created THEN each new orchestrator SHALL have langroid-implementation/, llamaindex-implementation/, haystack-implementation/, and strands-implementation/ directories
10. WHEN adapters are implemented THEN each new orchestrator SHALL have a corresponding adapter.py file implementing the AgentAdapter protocol

### Requirement 5: Advanced Benchmarking and Evaluation

**User Story:** As a technical evaluator, I want comprehensive benchmarking with multiple quality dimensions so that I can make informed decisions about framework selection based on objective metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarks are executed THEN the system SHALL support 5 task categories: Single-file Bug Fix, Multi-step Feature Addition, Question Answering, Code Optimization, and Edge Case handling
2. WHEN evaluating reliability THEN the system SHALL run multiple iterations with self-consistency checks and majority voting
3. WHEN measuring correctness THEN the system SHALL automatically verify outputs using pytest, linting, and semantic analysis
4. WHEN ensuring reproducibility THEN the system SHALL support record-replay functionality for deterministic testing
5. WHEN CLI is used THEN it SHALL support --framework, --tasks, --provider, --mode, --seed, and --out parameters
6. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and suggested improvements
7. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN results SHALL be exported in structured JSON format with comprehensive metadata

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Observability and Telemetry
