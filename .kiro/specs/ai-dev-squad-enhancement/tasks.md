# AI Dev Squad Comparison Enhancement - Implementation Plan

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Development**: Each task builds upon previous tasks with clear dependencies
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside implementation for immediate validation
- **Safety First**: Implement and test safety controls before adding new orchestrator capabilities
- **Documentation Parallel**: Update documentation as features are implemented
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add telemetry and monitoring from the beginning

### Integration Strategy
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality while adding new capabilities
- **Gradual Migration**: Migrate existing orchestrators one at a time to new interfaces
- **Validation at Each Step**: Ensure each component works before moving to the next
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to revert changes if issues are discovered

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, performance, and security tests for all components
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security, performance, and maintainability
- **Documentation Review**: All documentation validated for accuracy and completeness
- **Performance Validation**: All changes validated for performance impact
