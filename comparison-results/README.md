# AI Development Squad Framework Comparison Results

This directory contains the results of benchmarking and comparing different AI agent orchestration frameworks for building AI development squads.

## Overview

The comparison metrics in this directory provide objective data to help developers select the most appropriate framework for their specific needs. Each framework has been evaluated using the same set of standardized tests and metrics.

## Frameworks Compared

- **LangGraph**: Graph-based workflow framework for LangChain
- **CrewAI**: Role-based agent orchestration framework
- **AutoGen**: Conversational multi-agent framework
- **n8n**: Visual workflow automation platform
- **Semantic Kernel**: Plugin-based framework for Microsoft ecosystem

## Metrics Collected

The following metrics are collected for each framework:

1. **Setup Time**: Time required to set up the framework and get it running
2. **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of test tasks successfully completed
3. **Token Usage**: Number of tokens consumed for standard tasks
4. **Response Time**: Time taken to complete standard tasks
5. **Code Quality**: Evaluation of the quality of generated code
6. **Error Handling**: Effectiveness of error handling mechanisms
7. **Human Interaction**: Ease of human-in-the-loop interactions
8. **GitHub Integration**: Effectiveness of GitHub repository operations
9. **Local Execution**: Performance with Ollama models
10. **Extensibility**: Ease of extending the framework with custom functionality

## Test Suite

The test suite includes a variety of software development tasks of increasing complexity:

1. **Simple Function**: Implementing a basic function (e.g., Fibonacci calculator)
2. **Data Structure**: Implementing a data structure (e.g., binary tree)
3. **Algorithm**: Implementing an algorithm (e.g., sorting algorithm)
4. **API Integration**: Creating code that interacts with an external API
5. **Bug Fix**: Identifying and fixing bugs in existing code
6. **Code Review**: Reviewing and providing feedback on code
7. **Documentation**: Generating documentation for code
8. **Testing**: Creating test cases for implemented code

## Results Format

Results are presented in both tabular and chart formats:

- `comparison_table.md`: Comprehensive table of all metrics
- `charts/`: Directory containing visualization charts
  - `setup_time_chart.png`: Comparison of setup times
  - `completion_rate_chart.png`: Comparison of task completion rates
  - `token_usage_chart.png`: Comparison of token usage
  - `response_time_chart.png`: Comparison of response times

## How to Run Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks yourself:

1. Ensure all framework implementations are set up according to their respective README files
2. Run the benchmark script:
   ```bash
   python ../benchmark/benchmark_suite.py --all
   ```
3. View the results in this directory

## Interpretation Guide

When interpreting the results, consider:

- **Your specific use case**: Different frameworks excel in different scenarios
- **Resource constraints**: Consider token usage and response time if resources are limited
- **Development experience**: Consider setup time and ease of use for your team
- **Integration needs**: Consider compatibility with your existing tools and workflows
