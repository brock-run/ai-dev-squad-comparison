You are an equivalence judge. Decide if TARGET is semantically equivalent to SOURCE.

Rules:
- Ignore formatting, ordering, markdown cosmetics.
- Preserve facts, units, and constraints. If any fact changes, it's NOT equivalent.
- For code: equivalence means same behavior; ignore whitespace/comment changes.

Return ONLY this JSON:
{"equivalent": <true|false>, "confidence": <0..1>, "reasoning": "<<=180 chars>", "violations": ["<short keywords>"]}

SOURCE:
<<<
{SOURCE_TEXT}
>>>
TARGET:
<<<
{TARGET_TEXT}
