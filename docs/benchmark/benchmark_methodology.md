# AI Dev Squad Benchmark Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology for benchmarking different AI agent orchestration frameworks used in this project. The goal is to establish consistent metrics and evaluation procedures that can be applied across all implementations (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, n8n, and Semantic Kernel) to enable fair and meaningful comparisons.

## Benchmark Categories

We evaluate each framework implementation across four key categories:

1. **Functional Performance**: How well the implementation performs its intended tasks
2. **Resource Efficiency**: How efficiently the implementation uses computational resources
3. **Developer Experience**: How easy the implementation is to work with
4. **Integration Capabilities**: How well the implementation integrates with other systems

## Metrics

### 1. Functional Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Task Completion Rate | Percentage of tasks successfully completed | Number of completed tasks / Total number of tasks |
| Output Quality | Quality of generated code or solutions | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) + static analysis scores |
| Reasoning Accuracy | Accuracy of agent reasoning | Evaluation against ground truth (%) |
| Error Rate | Frequency of errors during execution | Number of errors / Number of operations |
| Hallucination Rate | Frequency of fabricated information | Manual review of outputs (%) |

### 2. Resource Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Description | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Execution Time | Time to complete standard tasks | Milliseconds (ms) |
| Memory Usage | Peak memory consumption | Megabytes (MB) |
| Token Consumption | Number of tokens used | Count of input + output tokens |
| API Calls | Number of API calls made | Count of external API requests |
| Cost | Estimated cost per standard task | USD ($) |

### 3. Developer Experience Metrics

| Metric | Description | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Setup Time | Time required to set up the implementation | Minutes |
| Lines of Code | Amount of code required for standard tasks | Count of non-comment lines |
| Documentation Quality | Completeness and clarity of documentation | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) |
| Customization Ease | Ease of customizing agent behavior | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) |
| Learning Curve | Steepness of learning curve | Survey results (1-10 scale) |

### 4. Integration Capabilities Metrics

| Metric | Description | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| GitHub Integration | Ease of integration with GitHub | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) |
| Local Model Support | Quality of Ollama integration | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) |
| API Extensibility | Ease of adding new API integrations | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) |
| Interoperability | Ability to work with other systems | Expert evaluation (1-10 scale) |
| Scalability | Ability to scale to larger workloads | Performance degradation under load (%) |

## Standard Benchmark Tasks

To ensure consistent evaluation, each implementation will be tested on the following standard tasks:

1. **Simple Code Generation**: Generate a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers with specific requirements
2. **Bug Fixing**: Identify and fix bugs in a provided code snippet
3. **Code Review**: Review a pull request and provide feedback
4. **Architecture Design**: Design a system architecture based on requirements
5. **Test Generation**: Generate unit tests for a provided code snippet
6. **Documentation Generation**: Generate documentation for a provided code snippet
7. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Solve a problem requiring collaboration between multiple agents

## Benchmark Process

1. **Setup**: Configure each implementation with identical settings where possible
2. **Execution**: Run each standard task 5 times to account for variability
3. **Measurement**: Collect metrics using automated tools and manual evaluation
4. **Analysis**: Calculate average scores and standard deviations
5. **Visualization**: Generate charts and tables for comparison
6. **Reporting**: Compile results into a comprehensive report

## Tools for Benchmarking

### Automated Measurement Tools

- **Performance Tracker**: Custom utility to measure execution time and resource usage
- **Token Counter**: Utility to count tokens consumed by each implementation
- **Code Quality Analyzer**: Integration with tools like SonarQube for code quality assessment
- **Memory Profiler**: Tool to measure memory consumption during execution

### Manual Evaluation Tools

- **Expert Evaluation Form**: Standardized form for expert evaluations
- **User Survey**: Survey for collecting developer experience feedback
- **Output Quality Rubric**: Standardized rubric for evaluating output quality

## Reporting

Results will be compiled in the `comparison-results` directory with the following structure:

- `raw_data/`: Raw measurement data
- `analysis/`: Processed data and statistical analysis
- `visualizations/`: Charts and graphs for visual comparison
- `reports/`: Comprehensive reports comparing all implementations

## Implementation-Specific Considerations

Each implementation may have unique characteristics that require special consideration during benchmarking. These considerations are documented in implementation-specific benchmark files.

## Continuous Benchmarking

Benchmarks should be run after any significant changes to ensure consistent performance over time. A CI/CD pipeline will be set up to automate this process.
