# [Framework Name] AI Development Squad Implementation

## Overview

[Provide a brief overview of the framework and how it's used for AI agent orchestration. Include key features and advantages of this framework for AI development squads.]

## Features

- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
- [Framework-specific feature]
- Integration with GitHub for code operations
- Local execution using Ollama models

## Architecture

[Provide a high-level architecture diagram or description of how the implementation is structured.]

```
[Optional ASCII or simple diagram showing the architecture]
```

### Components

#### Agents

- **Architect Agent**: [Description of the architect agent's role and capabilities]
- **Developer Agent**: [Description of the developer agent's role and capabilities]
- **Tester Agent**: [Description of the tester agent's role and capabilities]

#### Workflows

[Description of how workflows orchestrate the agents]

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [Framework] version X.Y.Z or higher
- Python 3.8+ (or appropriate language runtime)
- Ollama installed locally
- GitHub account with API access (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-dev-squad-comparison.git
cd ai-dev-squad-comparison/[framework]-implementation

# Create a virtual environment (if applicable)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or appropriate command for the framework
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your settings:
   ```
   # Required settings
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   
   # Ollama settings
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
   
   # Other framework-specific settings
   ...
   ```

3. Download recommended Ollama models:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   ollama pull codellama:13b
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from [framework_package] import [relevant_classes]

# Initialize the development squad
squad = DevelopmentSquad()

# Define a task
task = "Build a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers with memoization"
requirements = [
    "Must handle negative numbers",
    "Should be optimized for performance",
    "Should include proper error handling",
    "Should have clear documentation"
]

# Run the development workflow
result = squad.run(task, requirements)

# Access the results
print(result.code)
print(result.tests)
print(result.evaluation)
```

### Advanced Usage

[Provide examples of more advanced usage patterns, such as customizing agent behavior, handling complex tasks, etc.]

```python
# Example of advanced usage
