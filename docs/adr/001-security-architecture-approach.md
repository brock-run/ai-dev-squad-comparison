# ADR-001: Security Architecture Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context

The AI Dev Squad Comparison platform requires a comprehensive security system to safely execute AI agent code, manage file operations, control network access, and prevent prompt injection attacks. We need to design a security architecture that:

1. Provides defense-in-depth protection
2. Is modular and extensible
3. Integrates seamlessly with the configuration system
4. Supports different security levels for various environments
5. Provides comprehensive audit and monitoring capabilities

## Decision

We will implement a **layered security architecture** with four primary components:

1. **Execution Sandbox** - Secure code execution with Docker/subprocess isolation
2. **Filesystem Access Controls** - Path validation and file operation restrictions
3. **Network Access Controls** - Domain allowlists and request filtering
4. **Prompt Injection Guards** - Input/output filtering and attack detection
5. **Unified Policy System** - Centralized policy management and enforcement

### Architecture Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers that complement each other
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default with explicit allowlists
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions required for operation
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All security events logged for monitoring
- **Configuration-Driven**: Policies managed through unified configuration

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Monolithic Security Component
**Rejected**: Would create tight coupling and make it difficult to customize security policies for different domains (execution vs. network vs. filesystem).

### 2. External Security Service
**Rejected**: Would introduce network dependencies and latency. Our use case requires tight integration with the execution environment.

### 3. Operating System Level Controls Only
**Rejected**: OS-level controls (chroot, cgroups, etc.) are not portable across platforms and don't provide application-level security features like prompt injection detection.

### 4. Third-Party Security Framework
**Rejected**: Existing frameworks don't address the specific needs of AI agent security (prompt injection, LLM-specific threats) and would create external dependencies.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Protection**: Multiple security layers provide robust defense
- **Flexibility**: Each component can be configured independently
- **Extensibility**: New security components can be added easily
- **Auditability**: Complete visibility into security events and policy violations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple components require careful coordination
- **Performance**: Multiple security checks may introduce latency
- **Configuration Overhead**: Requires careful policy configuration management
- **Testing Complexity**: Each security layer needs comprehensive testing

## Implementation Notes

- Security components are implemented as independent modules in `common/safety/`
- Unified policy management through `SecurityPolicyManager` class
- Integration with existing configuration system via `config_integration.py`
- Comprehensive test coverage for each security component
- Example usage provided in `examples/` directory
