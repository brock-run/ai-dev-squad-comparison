## Building an AI Development Squad: Implementation Examples

Here are practical implementation examples for creating an AI coding/development squad using each framework:

### LangGraph Development Squad Example

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from typing import TypedDict, List

class DevSquadState(TypedDict):
    requirements: str
    code: str
    tests: str
    documentation: str
    review_feedback: str

def create_dev_squad():
    # Define specialized agents
    architect_agent = create_react_agent(
        model="gpt-4o",
        tools=[analyze_requirements, design_architecture],
        prompt="You are a senior software architect..."
    )
    
    developer_agent = create_react_agent(
        model="gpt-4o", 
        tools=[write_code, refactor_code],
        prompt="You are a senior developer..."
    )
    
    tester_agent = create_react_agent(
        model="gpt-4o",
        tools=[write_tests, run_tests], 
        prompt="You are a QA engineer..."
    )
    
    # Build workflow
    workflow = StateGraph(DevSquadState)
    workflow.add_node("architect", architect_agent)
    workflow.add_node("developer", developer_agent) 
    workflow.add_node("tester", tester_agent)
    
    # Define edges
    workflow.add_edge(START, "architect")
    workflow.add_edge("architect", "developer")
    workflow.add_edge("developer", "tester")
    workflow.add_edge("tester", END)
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

This creates a sequential development pipeline where each agent specializes in a specific phase[6][30].

### CrewAI Development Squad Example

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# Define specialized agents
product_manager = Agent(
    role='Product Manager',
    goal='Define clear requirements and manage development tasks',
    backstory="Expert in translating business needs into technical requirements",
    verbose=True
)

senior_developer = Agent(
    role='Senior Developer',
    goal='Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code',
    backstory="10+ years of experience in software development",
    tools=[code_analysis_tool, git_tool],
    verbose=True
)

qa_engineer = Agent(
    role='QA Engineer', 
    goal='Ensure code quality through comprehensive testing',
    backstory="Specialist in test automation and quality assurance",
    tools=[testing_framework, bug_tracker],
    verbose=True
)

# Define tasks
requirement_analysis = Task(
    description='Analyze requirements and create development plan for {project_description}',
    agent=product_manager,
    expected_output='Detailed development plan with tasks and timeline'
)

code_development = Task(
    description='Implement the features according to the development plan', 
    agent=senior_developer,
    expected_output='Complete, tested code implementation',
    context=[requirement_analysis]
)

quality_assurance = Task(
    description='Test the implementation and provide feedback',
    agent=qa_engineer, 
    expected_output='Test results and quality assessment',
    context=[code_development]
)

# Create the crew
dev_crew = Crew(
    agents=[product_manager, senior_developer, qa_engineer],
    tasks=[requirement_analysis, code_development, quality_assurance],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)

# Execute the workflow
result = dev_crew.kickoff(inputs={"project_description": "Build a REST API for user management"})
```

This example demonstrates CrewAI's role-based approach with specialized agents collaborating on a development project[31][32].

### AutoGen Development Squad Example

```python
import autogen

config_list = [
    {"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": "your-api-key"}
]

# Define specialized agents
project_manager = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Project_Manager",
    system_message="""You are an experienced Project Manager. Break down requirements 
    into manageable tasks and coordinate the development team.""",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

engineer = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Engineer", 
    system_message="""You are a senior software engineer. Write clean, efficient code 
    and follow best practices.""",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

code_reviewer = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Code_Reviewer",
    system_message="""You are a code reviewer. Analyze code for bugs, performance 
    issues, and adherence to best practices.""",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="User_Proxy",
    human_input_mode="TERMINATE",
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "coding",
        "use_docker": False
    }
)

# Create group chat
groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
    agents=[user_proxy, project_manager, engineer, code_reviewer],
    messages=[],
    max_round=20
)

manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config={"config_list": config_list})

# Start the conversation
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    manager,
    message="Create a Python web scraper for extracting product data from e-commerce sites"
)
```

This creates a collaborative environment where agents communicate to solve development tasks[12][33].

### n8n Multi-Agent Development Workflow

n8n excels at creating visual workflows that integrate multiple AI agents with external tools. Here's how to set up a development squad:

**Agent Configuration**:
1. **Requirements Agent**: Analyzes user input and creates detailed specifications
2. **Code Generator Agent**: Creates code based on requirements
3. **Test Agent**: Generates and runs tests  
4. **Review Agent**: Performs code review and suggests improvements
5. **Documentation Agent**: Creates technical documentation

**Workflow Setup**[20][34]:
```javascript
// Example n8n workflow structure
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Requirements Agent",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.aiAgent",
      "parameters": {
        "agent": {
          "systemMessage": "Analyze requirements and create detailed specs",
          "tools": ["web_search", "document_parser"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Code Generator", 
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.aiAgent",
      "parameters": {
        "agent": {
          "systemMessage": "Generate clean, efficient code based on specifications",
          "tools": ["code_executor", "git_integration"]
        }
      }
    }
    // Additional agents...
  ],
  "connections": {
    // Define agent handoffs and data flow
  }
}
```

The workflow supports dynamic agent calling and MCP-based communication between agents[21].
