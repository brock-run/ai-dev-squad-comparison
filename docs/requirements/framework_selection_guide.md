## Conclusion

Selecting the right AI agent orchestration framework depends on your specific project requirements, team expertise, and organizational constraints. Use this guide to make an informed decision based on your unique needs.

Remember that framework selection is not a one-time decision. As your project evolves, you may need to reassess your choice or even combine multiple frameworks for different aspects of your development workflow.

For most teams new to AI agent orchestration, starting with a simpler framework like CrewAI or n8n can provide a gentler learning curve while still delivering significant value. As your team gains experience and your requirements become more complex, you can consider migrating to more sophisticated frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, or Semantic Kernel.
