# AI Dev Squad Comparison â€” Product Requirements Document _(Last updated: 2025-08-11)_

## 1. Introduction
- **Team**: AI Platform Dev Group
- **Linked Docs**: [Guidelines](/.junie/guidelines.md), [AI Orchestration Options](/docs/research/ai-orchestration-options.md), [Multi-Agent Orchestration Details](/docs/research/multi-agent-orchestration-details.md)
- **Status**: V1.0

## 2. Problem Statement(s)
Software development teams struggle to effectively implement and compare different AI agent orchestration frameworks for building AI development squads. There's a lack of standardized examples and comparison metrics to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, n8n, OpenAI Swarm, and Semantic Kernel in software development workflows.

## 3. Goals
- Provide standardized implementations of AI development squads across major frameworks
- Enable objective comparison of framework capabilities, performance, and ease of use
- Support local execution with Ollama for accessibility and cost-effectiveness
- Demonstrate practical integration with GitHub for real-world development workflows
