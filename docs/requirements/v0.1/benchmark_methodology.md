# Benchmark Methodology

This appendix outlines the standardized methodology for benchmarking different AI agent orchestration frameworks in the context of software development tasks. The methodology ensures fair and consistent comparison across frameworks.

## Benchmark Objectives

The benchmarking process aims to evaluate frameworks across several key dimensions:

- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: SSD with at least 50GB free space

### Software Configuration

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS 13+
- Python: 3.10+
- Node.js: 18+ (for n8n)
- .NET: 7.0+ (for Semantic Kernel C#)
- Docker: Latest stable version

### Ollama Configuration

- Ollama version: Latest stable
- Models:
  - Primary: llama3.1:8b
  - Alternative: codellama:13b
  - Fallback: llama3.2:3b

### Network Configuration

## Testing Procedure

The following procedure is followed for each framework and test case:

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Install framework and dependencies
   - Configure Ollama integration
   - Set up GitHub integration
   - Prepare test environment

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Initialize the AI agent squad
   - Present the task requirements
   - Allow the agents to collaborate on the solution
   - Record all metrics during execution

3. **Evaluation Phase**
   - Assess the solution against evaluation criteria
   - Calculate performance metrics
   - Document observations and issues

4. **Reporting Phase**
   - Compile results into standardized format
   - Generate comparative visualizations
   - Document framework-specific observations

## Benchmark Execution

Each benchmark is executed multiple times to ensure statistical significance:

1. **Warm-up Run**
   - Initial run to prime the environment
   - Results discarded

2. **Measurement Runs**
   - 3 consecutive runs with the same parameters
   - Results averaged for final metrics

3. **Edge Case Runs**
   - Additional runs with resource constraints
   - Additional runs with complex requirements

## Result Normalization

To ensure fair comparison across frameworks with different characteristics:

1. **Performance Normalization**
   - Metrics are normalized relative to baseline implementation
   - Adjustments made for language-specific performance differences

2. **Resource Usage Normalization**
   - Baseline resource usage subtracted from measurements
   - Adjustments for framework-specific overhead

3. **Token Usage Normalization**
   - Adjustment for framework-specific prompt engineering
   - Consideration of different model requirements

## Reporting Format

Results are presented in a standardized format for easy comparison:
