# AI Squad Benchmarking Tool – High-Level Requirements

## Executive Summary

The AI Dev Squad Benchmarking Tool is designed for rigorous, rapid, and transparent evaluation of AI agent orchestration frameworks. Our goal is to empower technical leaders and teams with credible comparison tooling, drive open discourse in the multi-agent ecosystem, and lay the groundwork for community-led innovation and trust in automated development assistants.

---

## Vision & Core Priorities

**1. Credible Framework Evaluation:**

Give myself and my 50+ engineer teams a practical, time-efficient, and fair way to evaluate and select among diverse agent frameworks for real engineering work.

**2. Public Data and Decision Support:**

Transform benchmark runs into public, auditable data sets and reproducible reports so others actually understand how frameworks stack up on real tasks—and know which framework to use when.

**3. Open, Useful Platform:**

Open-source everything—make it modular and approachable so external contributors can extend task types, add frameworks, and rely on the platform as infrastructure for experiments, research, or their own deployments.

**4. Optional Future Commercialization:**

Lay a technical and organizational foundation that could support future “niche” monetization—without sacrificing openness or transparency.

## Keys to Success

Here’s where our attention and “getting it right” will hugely amplify the value and staying power of your platform:

### 1. **Onboarding, Simplicity, and Developer Experience**

The power of your tool is limited by how quickly someone can:

- understand how to spin up a new benchmark (for code, docs, agents, etc.)
- add a new framework or task, and see it reflected in CLI/config/results
- iterate (fail safely, see what needs to change, re-run, compare)

**Why it matters:** Your primary and early external “customers” are savvy developers; if they run into cryptic errors, unexplained fields, or a confusing CLI, friction will choke adoption even if your guts are great.

*How to get it right:*

- Nail the CLI/UX flow, and provide “champion” YAML examples and readable config/error docs right in the repo.
- Make “hello world” benchmarking work on Docker/Ollama or local cloudless install—no mandatory cloud credits or API keys for basic flows.
- Ship with several real-world, start-to-finish, reproducible public demos (ideally matching your intended team use cases).

---

### 2. **Reproducibility + Environment Capture**

The best benchmarking tool in the world fails if “re-run = ??”. You’ve already prioritized this in the data model, but double-down in operations and docs.

**Why it matters:** Engineers and researchers will only trust cross-framework results if “buttoned-up provenance” is obvious—inputs, seeds, environment versions, model configs, everything.

*How to get it right:*

- Bundle all config, environment, and results (including error logs and seeds) into self-contained exports.
- Validate environment capture on different machines and, if possible, offer a Docker Compose or “single script bring-up” option, so would-be testers aren’t left debugging install drift.

---

### 3. **Evaluation Framework Flexibility (Valid, Explainable, Pluggable)**

Automated evaluations, human rubrics, and LLM judges—each offers different kinds of trust/support. If you want your benchmark advice to stand up to scrutiny, and enable more creative use cases, build for pluggability, transparency, and explainable failure.

**Why it matters:** Public “data on frameworks” is only as useful as its evaluation credibility. Rigid pass/fail, evaluation black boxes, or closed-rubric scoring will get undermined on Twitter (and in your own team meetings).

*How to get it right:*

- Every evaluation type and result should show its scoring rubric or reasoning, alongside the artifact it’s judging.
- Allow users/devs to write, edit, and share new evaluation plugins (with clear registry/enums and YAML-driven criteria).
- Provide explainable failures—why an LLM judge or diff scored “0,” not just that it failed.

---

### 4. **Clear Extensibility Contracts and Community Patterns**

You want contributors to be able to add new frameworks, task types, evaluations, or agents efficiently.

**Why it matters:** The real-world agentic ecosystem is evolving fast. Your platform is much more valuable if it’s not bottlenecked on your team!

*How to get it right:*

- Enforce, validate, and document adapter “contracts”—what every new framework integration or task plug-in must implement, how error states are reported, how they reference the canonical data model.
- Keep sample and contract code as readable and idiomatic as possible (no hacks or hidden magic).
- Encourage contributions by labeling code, YAML, and docs with “add here!” and providing merging tools/tests/examples.

---

### 5. **Safety & Trustworthiness on by Default**

Safety isn’t just can-you-do-a-sandbox; it’s making sure every code path, tool, and agent can’t accidentally write to the wrong place, phone home, or produce silent partial outputs.

**Why it matters:** Even for internal use, accidental data leaks or test pollution erode confidence. For shared/public adoption, one “cat > /etc/passwd” is the end of trust.

*How to get it right:*

- Every code execution, file write, or API call runs through a single, aggressively controlled (and well-logged) sandbox path.
- By default, block network, limit filesystem, enforce time/memory, and provide clear error and recovery messages.
- Default “safe-mode” should be opt-out, not opt-in.

---

### 6. **Valid, Appealing Public Reporting/Export**

If you want to “advise” publicly, make sharing and consumption a cinch.

**Why it matters:** You only get “thought leadership” (or community feedback) if your exported results are readable, reproducible, and not just JSON blobs for the initiated.

*How to get it right:*

- Every run bundle can spit out human-readable Markdown/CSV alongside JSON.
- Explain both how to reproduce results and how to interpret key diffs, scores, and failures.
- Build a few hand-crafted, copy-pasteable share links or badges (e.g., “Framework X: Best for Refactoring in Python—4.8/5 over 12 runs”).

---

**Bottom Line:**
A strong data model lets you build a great platform; but a streamlined UX, ironclad trust/reproducibility, clear extensibility contracts, concrete evaluation/reporting, and baked-in safety will be what gets actual adoption—by your team, the public, and possibly future enterprise partners.

## Functional Requirements

**A. CLI-Driven Benchmark Suite**

- Single CLI (`bench`) for all actions: config, run, investigate, report, share.
- Instant feedback (table/summary/JSON) on task status, results, and errors.
- Zero web UI or cloud dependency required for core workflows.

**B. Pluggable Task, Agent, and Framework System**

- Tasks (feature add, refactor, optimize, code QA, doc gen, etc) are YAML/TOML/JSON defined and hot-swappable.
- Agents, prompts, tools, and rules are referenced by id/version—enabling easy A/B and tweak/replay experiments.
- Adding a new framework or evaluation is a config/edit, not a code rewrite.

**C. Reliable Reproducibility and Traceability**

- Full capture of config, agent/prompt/tool/rule version, random seed, environment details, and logs for every run.
- Output artifacts (patches, docs, test logs, etc) and run-level logs always exported, linked, and versioned.

**D. Side-by-Side Output Diff, Evaluation, and Reporting**

- Visual and CLI diff tools for output, logs, code, even doc and trace artifacts.
- Built-in support for automated, LLM, and human rubric evaluations—results always structured and reference-able.
- Summary generator for key reporting metrics (pass/fail, cost, time, tokens, explanation).

**E. Safety & Security**

- All agent-generated code exec’d in a production-ready sandbox with time, resource, and network/file I/O restrictions (minimal to start, extensible later).
- Rule enforcement and error reporting on safety breaches.

**F. Edge Case & Error Handling**

- Every task, run, diff, or evaluation can be partial, skipped, errored, or inconclusive—with clear status and structured error details.

**G. Highly Reusable Artifacts & Sharing**

- Anyone can rerun or share the full “provenance” of a benchmark: config, run metadata, logs, and all key artifacts.
- Publishing and collaborating requires no special dashboard (but remains dashboard-ready).

---

## Example User Journey

**Getting Started**

- User runs `bench init` and follows guided input or loads a provided YAML config.
- User checks config via `bench config show`; edits if necessary.

**Running and Monitoring a Benchmark**

- User triggers a run:`bench run --frameworks crewai,haystack --tasks refactor_func,optimize_func --repo ./myrepo --seed 42`
- CLI live updates a real-time table: frameworks × tasks × seeds, status, timing, and cost.

**Drilling Into Results**

- On completion, user sees a summary table in terminal and gets a path to `/results/bench_2024-04-14_xxxx/`
- User runs `bench report` for Markdown/JSON summary and can open side-by-side detailed outputs, diffs, logs, traces.

**Investigative Modes**

- CLI commands enable diffs on any artifact, not just code—logs, PRs, agent call chains, etc.

**Transparent Sharing**

- User uploads/export results package.
- Others can instantly replay runs using the same config/environment—or feed artifacts into their own dashboards.

---

## Scope/Non-Scope (to stay focused)

**In Scope:**

- Fully functional CLI, config-driven plug-ins, all critical tracking/traceability, basic sandbox, and side-by-side diff/report.

**Out of Scope:**

- Rich web UI (for v1; CLI-only to keep focus).
- Sophisticated auto-tuning/recommendation engine.
- Heavy integrations beyond core frameworks or dashboard automation.
- Any monolithic or hard-to-extend systems.

---

## Why These Requirements?

This approach prioritizes our need for rapid, repeatable evaluation—no vendor lock-in, no black box. Everything is built around auditability (for credible public claims) and zero-to-ninety-utility for our own squads. By baking in pluggability, safety, debugging, and data traceability, we’re ready both for hands-on engineering decisions and open scientific dialogue—the heart of both elite DevRel and open-source leadership.
