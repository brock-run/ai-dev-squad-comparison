# AI Dev Squad Comparison Project - Initial Implementation

## Overview

This Merge Request establishes the foundation for the AI Dev Squad Comparison project, which aims to evaluate and contrast various approaches to multi-agent orchestration in software development workflows. The project compares different AI agent orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, n8n, and Semantic Kernel) for building AI development squads with specialized roles (architects, developers, testers) that collaborate to accomplish software development tasks.

## Completed Work

### Project Structure and Documentation
- Established the project structure according to the PRD
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - Project overview and setup instructions in README.md
  - Detailed research on AI orchestration options
  - Implementation guides for multi-agent orchestration
  - Documentation templates for consistent framework documentation

### Framework Implementations
- Created implementation directories with consistent structure for all five frameworks:
  - **LangGraph**: A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs
  - **CrewAI**: A framework for orchestrating role-playing agents
  - **AutoGen**: A framework for building LLM applications with multiple conversational agents
  - **n8n**: A workflow automation platform with AI capabilities
  - **Semantic Kernel**: A framework for building AI applications with plugins

### Agent Implementation
- Implemented specialized agent roles for each framework:
  - Architect: Responsible for system design and architecture decisions
  - Developer: Handles code implementation based on specifications
  - Tester: Creates and runs tests for the implemented code

### Workflow Definitions
- Created workflow orchestration modules for each framework to manage agent collaboration
- Established consistent patterns for agent interaction across frameworks

## Current Status

### In Progress
- **Ollama Integration**: Developing a common interface for local model execution across all framework implementations
  - Implemented OllamaClient for API interaction
  - Created OllamaManager for model and configuration management
  - Developed AgentInterface for agent-specific interactions
  - Added performance tracking and error handling

## Next Steps

The following tasks are planned for upcoming work:

1. **GitHub API Authentication Module**: Implement authentication and repository operations for GitHub integration
2. **Benchmark Suite**: Create a comprehensive benchmark suite for framework comparison
3. **Results Dashboard**: Set up a visualization dashboard for comparison results

## Technical Details

### Ollama Integration

The Ollama integration module provides a unified interface for all frameworks to interact with local LLM models through Ollama. Key features include:

- Model management (listing, pulling, selection)
- Text generation and chat interfaces
- Role-specific model configuration
- Performance tracking and metrics
- Error handling and logging

### Framework Consistency

All framework implementations follow a consistent structure:
- README.md with framework-specific documentation
- requirements.txt with dependencies
- agents/ directory with specialized agent implementations
- workflows/ directory with orchestration definitions

This consistency will facilitate fair comparison between frameworks and make the codebase more maintainable.

## Conclusion

This MR establishes the foundation for the AI Dev Squad Comparison project, with completed implementation directories for all five frameworks and ongoing work on the Ollama integration module. The project is well-positioned to move forward with GitHub integration, benchmarking, and results visualization in the next phase.
