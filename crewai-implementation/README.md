## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Core CrewAI dependencies
pip install crewai langchain langchain-community

# Optional: For enhanced model support
pip install langchain-openai langchain-anthropic

# Optional: For local model support
pip install langchain-ollama

# Development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for LLM access
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"

# Optional: For VCS integration
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export GITLAB_TOKEN="your-gitlab-token"

# Optional: For local models
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
```

### 3. Configure Security Policies

The adapter uses the central security policy system:

```bash
# Check available policies
python -m common.safety.policy list

# Set active policy
python -m common.safety.policy set-active standard
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from crewai_implementation.adapter import create_crewai_adapter
from common.agent_api import TaskSchema

# Create adapter
adapter = create_crewai_adapter()

# Create task
task = TaskSchema(
    id="task-1",
    description="Create a REST API for user management",
    requirements=[
        "Implement CRUD operations for users",
        "Add input validation and error handling",
        "Include comprehensive tests",
        "Add API documentation"
    ],
    context={"language": "python", "framework": "fastapi"}
)

# Execute task
async for event in adapter.run_task(task):
    if event.type == "crew_start":
        print(f"Crew started with {event.data['agents']} agents")
    elif event.type == "task_complete":
        print(f"Task completed: {event.data['success']}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
config = {
    "language": "python",
    "max_rpm": 15,  # Requests per minute limit
    "vcs": {
        "enabled": True,
        "provider": "github",
        "repository": "myorg/myrepo",
        "create_pr": True
    },
    "architect": {
        "max_iterations": 5
    },
    "developer": {
        "max_iterations": 10
    },
    "tester": {
        "max_iterations": 7
    },
    "reviewer": {
        "max_iterations": 5
    }
}

adapter = create_crewai_adapter(config)
```

### Health Monitoring

```python
# Check adapter health
health = await adapter.health_check()
print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
print(f"Agents: {[k for k in health['components'] if k.startswith('agent_')]}")

# Get capabilities
capabilities = await adapter.get_capabilities()
print(f"Crew: {capabilities['crew_composition']}")
print(f"Features: {capabilities['features']}")
```

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### üèóÔ∏è Architect Agent
- **Role**: Software Architect
- **Goal**: Design robust and scalable software architectures
- **Capabilities**: System design, component breakdown, interface definition
- **Tools**: Safe code executor, file operations, VCS operations

### üíª Developer Agent
- **Role**: Senior Developer
- **Goal**: Implement high-quality, well-tested code
- **Capabilities**: Code implementation, documentation, configuration
- **Tools**: Safe code executor, file operations, VCS operations

### üß™ Tester Agent
- **Role**: QA Engineer
- **Goal**: Create comprehensive tests and ensure quality
- **Capabilities**: Test creation, quality metrics, performance testing
- **Tools**: Safe code executor, file operations

### üëÄ Reviewer Agent
- **Role**: Code Reviewer
- **Goal**: Review code for quality, security, and best practices
- **Capabilities**: Code review, security analysis, best practices validation
- **Tools**: Safe code executor, file operations

## Workflow Execution

The CrewAI workflow follows this sequence:

1. **Architecture Phase** ‚Üí Architect creates system design
2. **Development Phase** ‚Üí Developer implements based on architecture
3. **Testing Phase** ‚Üí Tester creates comprehensive test suite
4. **Review Phase** ‚Üí Reviewer validates quality and security
5. **VCS Phase** ‚Üí Automated commit and PR/MR creation (optional)

Each phase builds on the previous one, with agents having access to all prior work through task context.

## Safety Controls

### Execution Sandbox
- Docker-based isolation (preferred)
- Subprocess fallback for environments without Docker
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, time)
- Network isolation

### Tool Safety
- All tools wrapped with safety controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output filtering and validation
- Execution monitoring and logging

### Agent Guardrails
- Role-specific behavior constraints
- Output validation and quality control
- Memory management and cleanup
- Error handling and recovery

## VCS Integration

### Automated Workflows
```python
# Automatic VCS integration
task = TaskSchema(
    description="Add user authentication",
    context={
        "vcs": {
            "provider": "github",
            "owner": "myorg",
            "repo": "myproject",
            "create_pr": True
        }
    }
)
```

### Generated Artifacts

## Performance Considerations

### Agent Efficiency
- Role specialization reduces context switching
- Memory persistence improves collaboration
- Tool caching reduces redundant operations
- Parallel execution where safe

### Resource Management
- Configurable rate limiting (max_rpm)
- Memory cleanup between tasks
- Tool execution timeouts
- Agent iteration limits

### Scalability
- Stateless adapter design
- External memory storage support
- Horizontal crew scaling
- Load balancing capabilities

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
pytest tests/test_crewai_adapter.py -v
```

### Test Coverage Areas
- Agent creation and configuration
- Task execution and collaboration
- Safety control integration
- VCS workflow automation
- Tool functionality and safety
- Event emission and telemetry

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CrewAI not available**
   ```bash
   pip install crewai langchain
   ```

2. **Agent memory issues**
   - Increase max_iterations in config
   - Clear agent memory between tasks
   - Check memory persistence settings

3. **Tool execution failures**
   - Verify safety policy configuration
   - Check sandbox availability
   - Review tool permissions

4. **VCS integration issues**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"
   export GITLAB_TOKEN="your-token"
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

adapter = create_crewai_adapter()
```

### Agent Monitoring

```python
# Monitor agent interactions
capabilities = await adapter.get_capabilities()
print(f"Active agents: {capabilities['crew_composition']['agents']}")

# Check agent health
health = await adapter.health_check()
for component, status in health['components'].items():
    if component.startswith('agent_'):
        print(f"{component}: {status}")
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Task Initialization**: < 3 seconds
- **Simple Task Execution**: < 60 seconds
- **Complex Task Execution**: < 300 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB during normal operation

### Optimization Tips
- Use appropriate max_iterations per agent
- Configure rate limiting based on API limits
- Enable memory persistence for related tasks
- Use tool caching for repeated operations
